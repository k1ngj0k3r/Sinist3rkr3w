ANCHOR (non-negotiable):
• Doctor appointment with Monka

TOP 3 (realistic + calm):
1. Morning reset (coffee, meds, kids fed)
2. Doctor appointment (Monka)
3. Post ONE generated blog (Substack or Medium)

OPTIONAL (only if energy is there):
- 10-minute toy reset (living room OR kids’ room — not both)
- Light stretch or short walk

NOT TODAY (intentionally skipped):
- Big decisions (moving, Phoenix, Silver City)
- Deep financial math
- Heavy investigations or doom scrolling
